Software Design Principles:
Requirements Engineering
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements to ensure the software meets user needs. It involves:

Defines project scope and prevents scope creep.
Establishes a basis for quality assurance and testing.
Reduces risk of costly changes later in development.
Ensures stakeholder satisfaction and successful outcomes.
Software Design Principles
Software design principles are guidelines for creating maintainable, scalable, and robust software. Key principles include:

Modularity: Dividing software into independent modules.
Abstraction: Hiding complex details and exposing only necessary aspects.
Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a single unit or class.
Separation of Concerns: Dividing software into distinct sections with specific roles.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each module/class should have one responsibility.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subclasses should be replaceable with their superclasses without affecting program correctness.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
Benefits: Enhances maintainability, scalability, flexibility, and overall software quality.
